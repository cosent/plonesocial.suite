The plonesocial.* group of packages has become ploneintranet_.

Plone Intranet features a complete redesign and re-implementation of the
front-end user interface of plonesocial. The backend is largely unchanged
but extended with new features: liking updates, personalized tagging.

Work on the ploneintranet `code base`_ is sponsored by the
`Plone Intranet Consortium`_, a group of companies dedicated to delivering
the leading open source digital workplace platform, based on Plone.
Have a look, you'll like it. It's 100% open source.

Plonesocial and Plone Intranet are initiatives by Cosent_.

rewrite, before plonesocial.* got merged into ploneintranet.*.
